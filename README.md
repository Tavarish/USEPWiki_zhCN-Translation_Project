> UESPWiki:About
> The **Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages**, usually referred to as the UESP, is one of the most popular game guides for the [Elder Scrolls] gaming universe. Originating from [Dave Humphrey]'s original [Daggerfall FAQ], the site has continually grown and expanded to cover the entire series. Because UESP is constantly being worked on and perfected, it differs from your everyday game guide. Anyone can [start contributing] to our collaborative project. If you see a [stub] that you can expand, we highly encourage you to improve upon it. For many years, UESP has been the leading resource for the Elder Scrolls series. Only with your help and with the effort of the community can we continue to build this site.  

> If you want to learn more about the procedures of editing UESP, please see our [help files]. Also, if you want to learn a bit more about the history of our project, check out the [history page]. If you're looking for discussion, please visit any of the popular forums for the Elder Scrolls games. If you're looking for help with one of the Elder Scrolls games, check the copious FAQs and other information listed here.
